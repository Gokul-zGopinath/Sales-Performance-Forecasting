## 📊 Key Business Insights

- A small group of products contributed disproportionately to total profit, showing a Pareto distribution in product performance.
- Several products generated consistent losses despite contributing to sales volume, indicating pricing or cost structure issues.
- Higher discount levels were strongly associated with reduced or negative profit margins.
- Monthly sales trends showed seasonal fluctuations, but higher revenue months did not always correspond to higher profits.
